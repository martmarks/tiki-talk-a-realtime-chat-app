#Tiki-Talk-A is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—combined with Socket.IO for instant communication. The app allows users to send and receive messages in real time, see who is online, and view when others are typing. It features a clean and responsive user interface designed with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. To protect user data and secure access, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used for authentication and authorization. The application also uses Zustand for global state management, ensuring that different parts of the app stay in sync. Error handling is carefully implemented on both the front end and back end to improve stability and user experience. This paper covers the planning, development, and technical decisions behind Tiki-Talk-A, showing how real-time communication tools can be built using modern web technologies.
